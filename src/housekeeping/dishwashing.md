### TLDR;

- **Run the tap before you turn on the dishwasher** - This improves the water temperature in the prewash cycle. It is important your water is HOT.
- **Insert detergent into the prewash slot** - This is a great way to get more use out of the prewash cycle.
- **Clean filter / macerator** - Helps with improved water flow and reduces the risk of clogging.

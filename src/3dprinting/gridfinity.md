## Modeling for Gridfinity

### Fusion360 plugin

There is a [GrdifinityGenerator](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=7197558650811789) fusion360 plugin that will literally do all most all of the heavy lifting for you, simply pick wether you want magnets, holes, a label, and what dimensions you want, et voila.

## Baseplates

My personal favorite baseplate is the magnet snap-fit baseplate from [Gridfinity Magnet Light Baseplate](https://www.printables.com/model/250550-gridfinity-magnet-light-baseplate/files).
